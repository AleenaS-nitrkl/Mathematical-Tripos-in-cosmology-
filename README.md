The project begins with the study of the homogeneous and isotropic universe, focusing on geometry and dynamics. It covers symmetric three-dimensional spaces and the Robertson–Walker metric, followed by cosmological kinematics such as geodesics, redshift, and distance measures. Using tools from general relativity and differential geometry, the spacetime curvature of the FLRW metric is computed explicitly, leading to detailed derivations of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations, along with their physical interpretation.

Subsequent sections address cosmic inflation, including the horizon problem, scalar field dynamics, slow-roll inflation, and reheating. The project then explores the thermal history of the universe, covering local thermal equilibrium, entropy conservation, particle decoupling, neutrino decoupling, and Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

The repository is planned to extend to the study of the inhomogeneous universe, with chapters on cosmological perturbation theory, structure formation, and the origin of primordial fluctuations from inflation.

Overall, this repository serves as a concise yet comprehensive record of a theoretical cosmology project, emphasizing first-principles derivations, mathematical consistency, and clear physical interpretation.
